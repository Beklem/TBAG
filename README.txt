read me:

:P

i don't know  what to write in README's that much. But I left out a turtle.py file for fireworks due to a repeated error of the file instantly starting with castle_art. So that was excluded from the final project. This was super fun to create though. I learnt a lot about storyboarding, planning code flowcharts, error handling (a lot of it), and applying logic to items (like the camera in the game).
